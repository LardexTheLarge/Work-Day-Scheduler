Work day scheduler plan

core - user inputs plan for that hour of the day and 
there is a set of hours from 8am to 7pm. user can save
input for each hour to the local storage and can get 
input even if page is refreshed. clock on page is connected
to each hour on inputs so if the current time 12pm then 
the current time is color red and past time is gray and 
time to be is colored blue.

first - get hourly clock to show - done

second - get value to appear on input through local storage - done

third - get color to corrispond with hour of the day - not done
