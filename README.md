# Work-Day-Scheduler

  ## Description

  My program lets users input a plan for that hour of the day and there is a set of hours from 8am to 7pm. Users can save there inputs for each hour while the local storage saves what they have inputed. The clock on page is connected to each hour on inputs so if the current time is 12pm then the current time is the color red and past time is gray and future time is colored blue. The program was made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
